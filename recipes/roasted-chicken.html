    <h2>Description</h2>

    <pre>
        This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way my grandmother used to make it. 
        The method used in this recipe results in the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery 
        after it was cooked.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Chicken: </strong>This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is 
            larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>

        <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, 
            and onion powder.</li>

        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>

        <li><strong>Celery: </strong>Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the 
            celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, 
            salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of 
            remaining butter on the outside of chicken.</li>

        <li>Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.</li>

        <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the 
            juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
            the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest 
            for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>

    </ol>
